# 💫 About Me:
Hi 😁, my name is Andrew, and I'm a backend developer!<br>🐍 I primarily write in Python and Golang (Go), as I find these two languages fun and super interesting to work with.<br><br>⚙️ I enjoy building distributed systems for companies and startups, helping them scale effortlessly.<br>🚀 Currently, I'm working on Duncan, a web framework built in Golang. It’s designed to make it easy for developers like me, who enjoy working with Go and HTMX, to build web servers seamlessly.<br><br>🎨 In my free time, I love watching Anime and cartoons, and my favorite shows are:<br><br>SpongeBob SquarePants<br><br>Rick and Morty (I’m not sure if this counts as a cartoon, though 😄)<br><br>HunterXHunter<br><br>Solo Leveling
